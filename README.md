### In this repo

- README.md is a basic python crash course in one page
- [learn-python-the-hard-way.md](learn-python-the-hard-way.md) is some notes on learn python the hard way ebook
- [pandas.md](pandas.md) is a crash course on pandas (possibly also numpy)
- [pytorch.md](pytorch.md) is a crash course on pytorch


### Goals of this repo (dwd)

This is a quick run-through of the python programming language. I hope to focus on:

1. Fundamentals: how to do basic things, syntax. 
2. The system: where to get docs, how to debug etc 
3. Data Science libraries and tooling: namely pandas, numpy and pytorch.
  - An MRE of a workflow for each of those three (pandas, numpy and pytorch) would be great


### Intro and resources

- It's recommended [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlvfHOrF26M) to learn assembly, c and python, to get a feel for the abstractions going on when talking to a computer via a typical scripting language. 

# Syntax









# Classes

Show how to define a class etc. 

Python supports [multiple inheritance](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3277367/how-does-pythons-super-work-with-multiple-inheritance). When using `super()` in a child of a class which inherits from multiple parent classes, python uses the [Method Resolution Order](http://python-history.blogspot.com/2010/06/method-resolution-order.html) (MRO) to determine which method is called (more [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/3277407)).
