This is a quick run-through of the python programming language. I hope to focus on:

1. Fundamentals: how to do basic things, syntax. 
2. The system: where to get docs, how to debug etc 
3. Data Science libraries and tooling: namely pandas, numpy and pytorch.
  - An MRE of a workflow for each of those three (pandas, numpy and pytorch) would be great


# Intro and resources

- It's recommended [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlvfHOrF26M) to learn assembly, c and python, to get a feel for the abstractions going on when talking to a computer via a typical scripting language. 



# Syntax
