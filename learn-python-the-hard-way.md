As always, this is a working doc. An attempt to summarise the learnings from [*Learn Python the Hard Way*](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/)

- Unclear whether this should be here, but my own pythonnotes: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Io9lLJuSm58cXrBIpVhbu6_u7w3BZ3fG0eWbQBhrSD0/edit


### My own tidbits


- Make a file called `test.py`, inside it, place `print(2 * 2)`, in the terminal type `python3 test.py`, and that should print 4 to the screen.

- You can start python in the terminal with `python3`, but also something like `python3.8` (note: apparently on [windows](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/ex1.html) you always type `python` rather than `python3`). 


### Notes from LPTHW


```py
# Multiple arguemnts to print() will print them space-separated
print("hi there", 3 + 2)
# hi there 5

print("Is it greater?", 5 > -2)
# Is it greater? True


round(1.73333)
# 2


# f-strings
pet = "dog"
f"my pet {avariable}"
# 'my pet dog'










```




MY TODO LIST
How to tell an object's class/type
how to convert "5" to interger, float
How to define a dict/hash, or whatever it's called
How to look up documentation for a method (e.g. .format())
Is there an interactive debugger?
